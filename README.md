# Kickass ML Demos ðŸ¤¯

There are a lot of repos on Github with really cool Machine Learning / Deep Learning project ideas and implementations. But most of them are either research oriented (with a very painful setup process) or not are too raw/half-baked to be good product demos. I love hackathons and building demo-able MVPs. The motivation of this repo is to put such wonderful projects with really kickass ðŸ¤¯ demos, created by wonderful people of the internet, in one place. I've split the projects into : Live-Demo-Ready and Core-Pipeline-Ready sections
